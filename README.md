This repository is an **unofficial** repository of the paper "Training Meta-Surrogate Model for Transferable Adversarial Attack". I implemented this paper for comparison with our [Dark Surrogate Model](https://github.com/ydc123/Dark_Surrogate_Model).

You can run to `run.sh` to train meta surrogate models. The source model `resnet18_CE` can be downloaded from our [Dark Surrogate Model](https://github.com/ydc123/Dark_Surrogate_Model).
